# Creating an AWS S3 Bucket

This Terraform template creates an S3 bucket in AWS. The bucket name and tags are specified in `variables.tf`. The `main.tf` file defines the `aws_s3_bucket` resource.

To create the S3 bucket, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the bucket is created, you can upload files to it using the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

bucket_name = "my-bucket"

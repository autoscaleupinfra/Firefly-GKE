# Creating a Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster

This Terraform configuration creates a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a specified number of nodes, machine type, and disk size. The cluster is created in a specified region of a specified Google Cloud project.

To create the cluster, set the required variables in `variables.tfvars` and run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=variables.tfvars
```

After the cluster is created, you can interact with it using the `gcloud` command-line tool. For example, to get the credentials for the cluster, run:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --region <region> --project <project-id>
```

Example `variables.tfvars` file:

```
project_id   = "my-project"
region       = "us-central1"
cluster_name = "my-cluster"
node_count   = 3
machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
disk_size_gb = 100
```

Example output:

```
Outputs:

cluster_ca_certificate = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgIBATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAVMRMwEQYDVQQDEwpH...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
cluster_endpoint        = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
```
